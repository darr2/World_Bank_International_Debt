# World_Bank_International_Debt

This project looks at the international debt which is collected by [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/).
We go through exploratory data analysis using the PostgreSQL DBMS to understand and answer questions such as:
    <ul>
        <li>What is the total debt?</li>
        <li>Which countries have the most debt?</li>
        <li>The average amount of debt across indicators?</li>
        <li>Which debt indicator is the most common?</li>
    </ul>
    
We are interested in national and international debt since this is a major factor in determining
the economic health of a country and the world, thus both consumers and governments are affected.
